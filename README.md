# Phil's Discord Bot
`Not compatible with Python 3.7 yet!`

### Debugging with Visual Studio Code
A launch profile is included in the project which runs the application as
Python Module. To authenticate the bot with Discord, please create a file
named `.env` in the project root and write the following to it:
```bash
BOT_TOKEN="<your-discord-bot-token>"
```
